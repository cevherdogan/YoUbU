# 🐝 **U b U – United by Unemployment**

### *“You bee You.”*

**Because being you is enough.**
You don’t need to fit in. You don’t need to prove a thing.
You just need a chance to show up—and **build with others** who feel the same.

U b U is a **cooperative hive** of unemployed and underemployed humans who are:

* Done with being left out.
* Done with waiting for permission.
* Done with resumes being the gate to belonging.

It’s a **community, a platform, and a mindset**:

* 🛠️ **Build.** Bring your skills, your ideas, your effort.
* 🧭 **Belong.** No degrees. No gatekeepers. Just contribution.
* 💰 **Benefit.** Earn based on what you do, together.

## **🧠 Philosophy**

We believe everyone has a spark.
We believe labor isn’t just gigs—it’s the act of **showing up and creating value.**
We believe in shared success, transparent ownership, and personal reinvention.
