Template Generator Engine - Contextual Cookie Cutter System

# Template Generator Engine - Contextual Cookie Cutter System

## Purpose

This document defines the outer-scope design for a separate **Template Generator Repository** that serves as a meta-layer for generating GitHub repositories like **U b U (United by Unemployment)** using contextual, smart templating logic.

## Core Intent

Rather than only templating the `U_b_U` project itself, this system acts as a **universal scaffold generator**â€”creating customized repo structures dynamically, based on user interaction data, prompts, or project intent.

## Key Components

* `create_repo.py`: A modular cookie-cutter-style Python script
* `tag-release.sh`: For automatic semantic tagging
* `RELEASE_NOTES.md` / `CHANGELOG.md`: Injected by version or rule-based logic
* Template folders: Populated selectively based on context (e.g., AI toolkits, automation scripts, web apps, etc.)

## Directory Overview

* `templates/`: Core folders like `docs/`, `src/`, `configs/`, etc.
* `logic/`: Context matching, tag interpreters, and GPT-assisted generation
* `scripts/`: CLI tools like `gen-template`, `init-project`
* `metadata/`: Rulesets and example JSON/YAML project definitions
* `.github/`: Actions for release, tagging, syncing

## Smart Generation Logic

* User interaction history or prompt keywords generate `project_profile.json`
* Templates adjust based on attributes like:

  * Project type (GPT tool, dashboard, API service)
  * Team roles (solo dev, community, documentation-focused)
  * Deployment stack (Vercel, Hostinger, Docker, etc.)

## Sample Flow

1. User runs: `python create_repo.py --profile my_project_profile.yaml`
2. Script loads the profile and assembles appropriate folders/files
3. Final structure is zipped or pushed to GitHub with a version tag

## Integration Options

* GitHub Template Repos
* CLI and web UI support
* GPT plug-in for auto-configuring new ideas
* Airtable/Notion integrations for dynamic prompt matching

## Roadmap

* Build and test `project_profile.yaml` structure
* Link to project history from other GPT-powered tools
* Add rule-based modifiers for releases, keywords, and tags

## Notes

This repo acts as the **template generator layer**, while projects like **U b U** are the **target children**. This system makes repo creation scalable, contextual, and partially autonomous.
